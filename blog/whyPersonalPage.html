                              In today's fast-paced digital world, making a great first impression is key. 
                              For most of us, that first impression comes from a resume or CV. 
                              These documents are designed to give a quick summary of your qualifications and experience. 
                              But if you're like me, you've probably noticed that resumes can be pretty limiting. 
                              That's why I decided to create a personal web page—a space where I can really showcase 
                              my projects and achievements without worrying about cramming everything into two pages.     
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> The Problem with Resumes</h2>
                         <p>
                              Resumes and CVs are definitely important when you're job hunting or networking. 
                              But let's be real, they have their limitations. 
                              Most career advice tells you to keep your resume to one or two pages, 
                              which means you only have space to highlight your most important qualifications, 
                              experience, and skills. 
                              The idea is that someone should be able to read it in under five minutes and get 
                              a good sense of who you are. 
                              But because of this, a lot of really cool stuff you've done might not make the cut.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> Too Much to Fit In</h2>
                         <p>
                              Throughout my student life, I've worked on a ton of different projects, 
                              in coursework and extracurricular activities. 
                              Each one has taught me something new and helped me grow. 
                              But when it came time to update my resume, I often found myself 
                              struggling to fit everything in without making it look cluttered. 
                              Important details were either reduced to a few bullet points or left out entirely. 
                              It was frustrating because I felt like my resume didn't fully capture the scope of my work.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> Why a Personal Web Page?</h2>
                         <p>
                              That's where my personal web page comes in. 
                              Unlike a resume, my website doesn't have any space limitations. 
                              It's a place where I can go into detail about each project, 
                              including the context, challenges, solutions, and results. 
                              This lets visitors get a much deeper understanding of what I can do.
                         </p>

                         <h2 class="major"> Why Not Everyone Has a Personal Web Page?</h2>
                         <p>
                              Most people think that is not necessary to have a webpage. 
                              One good reason today is because of the availability of social network websites.
                              In the past, it was more difficult and costly to host a website. Now a days 
                              social feeds is the norm for communicating with familly, friends and collegues.
                              Ironically, because the peaple that have personal webpages is limited, 
                              it becomes intrinsically a skill which sets you apart from the rest. 
                              It lets you stand out when you are searching for career and project colabotation 
                              opportunities.   
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> Showcasing My Range </h2>
                         <p>
                              One of the best things about having a personal web page is that 
                              I can showcase a wide variety of projects—from professional work to personal hobbies and side projects. 
                              This helps highlight my diverse skill set and shows that I'm always learning and growing. 
                              I can include case studies, project timelines, code snippets, and even multimedia elements like images and videos. 
                              This makes my professional story much more engaging and complete, 
                              especially for students like me that don’t have formally work experience and want to demonstrate what skills you have.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> Keeping It Up-to-Date </h2>
                         <p>
                              Another great thing about a personal web page is that it's dynamic. Unlike a static resume, 
                              I can update my website whenever I complete a new project or learn a new skill. 
                              This keeps my professional profile current and relevant, making it easy for potential employers, 
                              collaborators, and clients to see what I've been up to lately.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> Building My Brand </h2>
                         <p>
                              In addition to showcasing my projects, my personal web page also helps with personal branding. 
                              It's a reflection of my style, personality, and professional philosophy. 
                              Through careful design and thoughtful content, I can create a unique online presence 
                              that sets me apart from others in my field.
                         </p>
                         <h2 class="major"> Conclusion </h2>
                         <p>
                              Building a personal web page allowed me to go beyond the constraints of a traditional resume 
                              and present a more detailed, engaging, and accurate picture of my life journey. 
                              If you're feeling restricted by your resume, 
                              I highly recommend creating your own personal web page. 
                              It's a great way to invest in your personal brand and show off all the awesome stuff you've done.
